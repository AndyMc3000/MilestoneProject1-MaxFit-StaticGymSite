Please see below details of 'Client Stories' to detail the requirements of the business owners, and 'User Stories' which highlight the requiremnts of end users of the website. Following the determination of 'Client' and 'User' stories and their subsequent technical requirments, the site was designed using the principles of Jesse James Garrett's '5 Planes of UX Design'.
