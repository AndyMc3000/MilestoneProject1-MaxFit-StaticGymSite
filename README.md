## 1. <a name="introduction-heading">Introduction</a> ##

The MaxFit website is my Milestone Project 1 (MS1) for my Diploma in Software Engineering course at Code Institute. The below refers to MaxFit as a fictional client of mine, where I have been hired to develop a website for them to meet certain requirements (see UX section below). However the underlying goal of the project is to meet and exceed the requirements laid out for the MS1 by Code Institute. The main goal of the MS1 is to "..build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far." Those principle technologies being HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap front-end framework.

MaxFit is a Gym and Fitness Club based on the beautiful shores of Lough Leane, Killarney. MaxFit is run by a passionate and inclusive group of fitness experts and professionals, and boasts state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. At MaxFit, their goal is to maximise the potential within their members.

## 2. <a name="user-experience-design">User Experience Design (UX)</a> ##

The design of this website was determined by assessing and quantifying the goals and objectives of the website owners, as well as the requirements of end users who will visit and use the website. Following the determination of 'Client' and 'User' stories and their subsequent technical requirments, the site was designed using the principles of Jesse James Garrett's '5 Planes of UX Design'. The outcome or tasks created for each plane is outlinined below.

### The 5 Planes of UX Design: ###

#### 1. The Strategy Plane ####
Please see below details of 'Client Stories' to detail the requirements of the business owners, and 'User Stories' which highlight the requiremnts of end users of the website.

#### Client Stories ####
> - [x] “The main goal of the website is to attract new customers, and provide value to existing customers in the information is provides.”
> - [x] “The website must show and promote the quality of the facilities at MAXFIT.”
> - [x] “The website must detail Membership costs and features (Gold & Silver Passes, each with 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, student/senior pricing).” 
> - [x] “The website must allow people to easily contact MAXFIT to arrange a free fitness consultation.”
> - [x] “The website must promote details about MAXFIT’s 1-month free trial membership offer.”
> - [x] “The website must promote MAXFIT’s Personal Training services.”
> - [x] “The website must detail the classes MAXFIT currently offer and highlight their costs and schedule/frequency.”
> - [x] “The website must visually appeal to potential customers from all walks of life. MAXFIT is not just a ‘hard-core workout’ gym, it is an fitness and wellness centre too. MAXFIT’s range of services appeal to customers of all age groups, male and female.”
> - [x] “The website must promote the fact that MAXFIR offers 24-hour access.”
> - [x] “The website must promote MAXFIT’s social media channels” 
> - [x] “The website must show some testimonial quotes”
> - [x] “There must be a system in place to track website usage statistics and end user interactions. All MAXFIT owned internet-connected computers, routers, or devices should be automatically excluded from website statistics/reports.”
> - [x] “The website must be mobile-friendly.”

#### User Stories ####
> - [x] “I want to see what kind of facilities MAXFIT have.”
> - [x] “I want to find about the different classes MAXFIT run.”
> - [x] “I want to find out when certain classes are on at.”
> - [x] “I want to be able to see where MAXFIT is located.”
> - [x] “I am interested in a membership and want talk to someone about what is best for me.”
> - [x] “I am interested in a membership and want to understand what the costs are.”
> - [x] “I want to find out a little bit about the people who work at MAXFIT.”
> - [x] “I want to see what other people say about MAXFIT”.

#### Interaction Design: ####

Interaction design is defined as the "development of application flows to facilitate user tasks, defining how the user interacts with site functionality (Copyright 2000 James Garrett)." Inline with this principle, the pages were designed as follows;

1. The Homepage;
* It should contain a call-to-action to promote the free fitness consultation offer.
* It should have links to the Free Consultation callback form.
* It should contain a section to promote free trial offer.
* It should contain a link to the Free Trial sign-up form.
* It should also contain a ‘why us’ section highlighting 4 main features/benefits of using MAXFIT - The Gym/equipment, Personal Training, Classes, and Membership benfits.
* It should contain a section to show Testimonial quotes.

2. The Services page;
* It should have 3 main sections focusing on; The Gym/equipment, Personal Training Services, and the Studio/class facilities.
* The sections should show detailed text information and a gallery of photographs.

3. The Classes page;
* It should contain a short section giving details of what each class is, a link how much it costs, what the current timetable for the class is, and who runs the class.
* Each section should also contain images/gallery relevant to the class.

4. The Membership page;
* It should contain pricing information for the different offerings/packages.
* It should contain a 'hero' section which details the Free Trial offer. This should link to the Free Trial sign-up form.

5. The Team page;
* It should contain contain information about the site management team and personal trainers.
* It shoud offer a quoick bio, a photo, and qualification details for each team member.
* It should contain messaging around a mission statement.

6. The Contact page;
* It should contain address and contact information.
* It should include a Google Map.
* It should contain a contact form with a dropdown to allow users to indicate their are of interest: Sign-up to a plan, Free Trial, or Free Consultation.

#### Information Architecture: ####

Infromation Architechture is defined as; "The structural design of the information space to facilitate intuitive access to content" (Copyright 2000 James Garrett). As such MaxFit was designed to allows a user to find the information they need easily. For example, the navigation bar is fixed to the top of the page view so is always immediately accessible, and buttons and links are clearly visible and communicate their purpose in an unambiguous way.

The structure of the website and outline of page sections is outlined in the Sitemap. Click the link to view the <a href="assets/readme-assets/maxfit-sitemap-final.png"><strong>Sitemap.</strong></a>

## 3. <a name="development-process">Development Process</a> ##

I implemented the following process for building the website;

1. Design - design the site based on the User Stories requirements, by reviewing fitness club/gym websites and creating wireframes/sketches.
1. Structure - write HTML code for all pages; navigation, footers, sections, galleries, forms, iframes.
1. Content - add text content to sections (lorem ipsum/placeholder text) and images to galleries. 
1. Style - add colours and fonts and write CSS rule sets and media queries in order to style the site.
1. Responsive - make sure all texts/headings, images, and container elements transform approprately and look good when viewed on different devices such as: mobile phones, tablets, laptops, large screen computers (PC's), and large TV's.  
1. Testing - validate HTML and CSS code, and test functionality of site elemenst on different devices and browsers.
1. Review - a last review of all code (formatting etc), content, fixing anys bugs/typo's etc.

## 7. <a name="deployment">Deployment</a> ##

This site was developed by firstly setting up a GitHub repository to store the website files. GitHub is a free online code hosting platform for websites or web applications, which enables version control and collaboration during the development of a project. A repository on GitHub containes all of a project's files and each file's revision history. You can learn more about GitHub and repositories here: [Click here to go to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github)

I used the online GitPod Integrated Development Environment (or GitPod IDE) to write the site code. Once I was happy with a section of code I commited or saved that to the working version of the website on GitPod. I then 'pushed' those changes from the GitPod IDE to my GitHub repository where the master set of files was updated. You can learn more about GitPod: [Click here to go to GitPod](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github)

Early on in the development process I also deployed the website to a live web address using GitHub Pages. GitHub pages is a free static-site hosting service. It takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from a GitHub repository and publishes a website with them. Once setup, any changes you make on your IDE which are subsequently 'pushed' to your GitHub repository, are automatically updated on GitHub Pages too. 

Here are the steps I took to deploy the website on GitHub Pages;
1. Login to GitHub.
1. Select 'Your Repositores' by selecting the dropdown button on the your account icon at the top right-hand corner of the screen. 
1. When you get to the Your Repositories page, select the project you want to deploy.
1. When in the individual repository page, click on the Settings icon from the lists of options above the repository file list (settings can be seen listed on the far-right of this list).
1. Once in the settings page, scroll down the GitHub Pages section near the bottom of the page.
1. Under the Source section, select the branch of the project you want to deploy from the first dropdown box (normally the master branch).
1. Also under the Source section choose the folder of the files you wnat to deploy (normally '/root').
1. Once you have made your selection, click Save. This will deploy your site to a unique URL. Once the site has been deployed, green text with a tcick mark will appear above the Source secion to notify you that deployment has been successful, and will also show you the URL for the website.

I deployed the website early on in the developmnt process, as it useful to be able to examine the website on various physical devices in its live state. Also, while the GitPod IDE has the ability to show a preview of changes to a project, sometimes that does not pick up or display issues which would appear on a live site. For example, when I deployed my website on GitHub Pages initially, I found that it was not reading my CSS file, so no styling was appearing on the site. The Preview tab in GitPod was reading the CSS file correctly. I found that a typo relating to the CSS file source address in my page headers caused the issue for the deployed site, while GitPod Preview did not pick it up. By having the deployed site up and running, I was able to address and correct the bug early in the development process.

The working version of the MAXFIT website deployed on GitHub Pages can be seen here: [Click here to view deployed website](https://andymc3000.github.io/maxfit-codeinstitute-ms1project-static-gym-website/)
