### Acknowledgements ###

I took inspiration from 2 websites in particular. One is for a small local gym based in Co.Cork, the other is a global fitness and wellness corporate based in the U.S. These websites are;
Website 1 | Website 2
--------- | ---------
https://www.equinox.com/ | https://www.themovement.ie/
Global locations  | Macroom, Co.Cork

I rewordered some of the marketing slogans and text content from Equinox and used those on my site.
